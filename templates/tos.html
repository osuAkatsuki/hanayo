    <p>Thank you for playing on Akatsuki! By playing, you agree to follow the below guidelines. Doing so could warrant immediate removal from our services.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Absolutely no botting, cheating, or hacking. This includes any method of giving yourself an unfair advantage over other players.
        <li>If you see someone breaking the rules, report them in-game or in our discord. Knowingly helping someone who breaks our terms of service can lead to removal from our services.
        <li>You may only have one account on Akatsuki. Creating more accounts will lead to those accounts being disabled and your first account restricted. If you for some reason need more than one account, please contact us directly.
        <li>Do not use any other person's account. This is known as account sharing and is taken quite seriously. Sharing your login details with any other user can result in a permanent ban.
        <li>Do not try to exploit bugs found on the server, report them to a developer immediately for a fair reward.
        <li>All communications on our Discord and in-game public chats must be in English. Players are allowed to use any language in other forms of communication.
        <li>Treat all members of Akatsuki with respect. Do not insult people without warrant & do not be excessively toxic.
        <li>Do not harass people. If a member asks you to stop harassing them, simply stop doing so. This rule is heavily enforced, so please be nice.
        <li>Absolutely no racism, sexism, transphobia, whatever. This includes slurs.
        <li>Do not discuss cheating, other servers, or breaking any US or International law in any of our services. Doing so will result in an immediate ban and if neccessary reported to relevant authorities.
        <li>Don’t spam or flood, unless you’re occasionally sending a link to e.g. Twitch when you’re streaming Akatsuki when no discussion is going on.
        <li>NSFW and offensive avatars/userpage content are not allowed anywhere on Akatsuki.
        <li>Do not impersonate any user, especially staff. This is enforced quite heavily.
        <li>Do not cause unneeded drama. Use the appropriate channels to report rule breaking; Hackusating in public channels is not allowed. Complaining about a user's ban in public channels is also dissalowed. Bans are to be kept between Akatsuki staff and the user only.
        <li>Purchasing anything from Akatsuki does not mean that you are immune from the rules.
        <li>Akatsuki services are meant for users that are 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13, do not use our services without parental consent.
        <li>Practice common sense. If a staff member asks you to do something, it is in your best interests to comply.
    </ul>

    <p>Don’t abuse our patience; while we try to best satisfy our users’ need, if you repeatedly infringe our rules or abuse services provided by the staff (e.g. appealing and name changing) (with particular regard to users who also disrespect our staff’s efforts, passively or actively, or are otherwise toxic within the community), we will first warn you, and if it comes to it we will offer an ultimatum. If you refuse or otherwise don’t change your behaviour, we’ll have no choice but to ban you. If you are found damaging the server directly - attempted attacks, chargebacks, hacking users, damaging reputation etc; your entire account data will be removed with no chance of being recovered ever.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the Akatsuki team can disable your access to the game, website, Discord server or any service provided by Akatsuki; without any warning, by staff members' discretion. You may not hold Akatsuki liable for any consequence that might happen due to you taking part in consumption of any service ran by Akatsuki. The Akatsuki team may change this list of rules at any time, with or without any notice. New rules may or may not be retroactive at our own discretion.</p>
